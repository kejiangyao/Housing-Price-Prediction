# Housing-Price-Prediction
Introduction
For this weekâ€™s project, we are given Nashville housing data (Nashville_housing_data.csv) with attributes of recent sales of houses such as Land Use, Property Address, Sale Date, Land Value, Building Value, Year built, etc. To assist this real estate company on making a huge investment into the growing Nashville area, we are planning to build a model that would help to accurately find the best value deals of each house so that this could help the company identify what the key factors in finding the best deal may be.

There are six parts needed to be complete:
Part 1:
Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.
Part 2:
Build a linear regression model to accurately predict housing prices and determine what is driving those prices.
Part 3:
Build a decision tree model and compare the results with the results of the previous model.
Part 4:
Build a Random Forest model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.
Part 5:
Build a Gradient Boost model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.
Part 6:
Use multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast the three models. Based on your findings, provide evidence of which model you believe the real estate company should use.


Both of these six parts will be completed using Python on Jupyter Notebook. Necessary codes and visuals will be attached directly within this report, and the full python script will be submitted separately in another file.
